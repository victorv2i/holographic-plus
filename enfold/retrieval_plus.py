"""Faster drop-in FactRetriever for enfold.

Two hot-path fixes over the parent retriever, with scoring semantics kept
identical:

1. The query HRR vector is encoded ONCE per search. The parent re-encodes
   the query inside the candidate loop (one encode_text call per candidate,
   measured at roughly 18 ms each at current dimensions), which dominated
   prefetch latency.
2. FTS candidates are fetched with explicit columns, excluding the large
   hrr_vector blob that the parent's ``SELECT f.*`` drags through SQLite
   overflow pages for every candidate row. Blobs are then loaded in a single
   targeted query, only for the candidates that get HRR-scored, and not at
   all when HRR scoring is disabled (hrr_weight == 0 or numpy missing).

Note on (2): the parent HRR-scores every FTS candidate, so all candidates
that have a stored vector still need their blob when HRR is enabled. The win
is that rows without vectors, and every search with HRR disabled, no longer
pay the blob read, and the candidate dicts never carry blobs around.

        The parent feeds the raw query straight into ``facts_fts MATCH ?``.
        FTS5 then parses it as a query *expression*: a hyphen is the NOT
        operator (``agent-deck`` -> ``agent NOT deck``), and ``:`` ``.`` ``/``
        ``~`` ``'`` raise syntax errors, so almost every real query either
        errors out (caught -> empty) or, with default AND semantics, requires
        every token to co-occur in one short fact and matches nothing. Lexical
        recall is effectively dead.

        This extracts the index's own tokens, drops stopwords (only while a
        content token survives), wraps each survivor in double quotes so no
        character is treated as an operator, and ORs them. OR maximises recall;
        BM25 ``rank`` ordering plus the downstream Jaccard/dense/trust rerank
        restore precision. Returns ``""`` when nothing significant remains, so
        the caller can skip the MATCH entirely.
